# Conversion rate

This project has been realized to validate the Jedha Bootcamp certification (Machine Learning module).

## Company's Description 📇
www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !

## Project 🚧
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

## Deliverable 📬
To complete this project : 
- Create some relevant figures for EDA
- Train at least one model that predicts the conversions and evaluate its performances (f1, confusion matrices)
- Make at least one submission to the leaderboard 
- Analyze your best model's parameters and try to make some recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future
